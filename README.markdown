General Info
------------

PyTouch is a GTK clone of freeware program Pytacz Master (PM) written in
Python using pygtk module.

It was created to ask questions on various topics based on a created test
It is designed for you to remember all the things in the test.

The main goal for me was to make similar program working with linux without
need to use wine. It probably won't have so many features as PM, but i plan
to implement the most important ones along with test editor.


Launching
---------

	$ ./pytouch.py

or just execute it by double clicking this file.


Example of test
---------------

It's available in tests/test.txt

It uses native files of PM cause I wanted it to be compatible with the Windows
version (at the moment created tests are not), but I'm experiencing some
trouble with encoding while doing own tests.
