						-1- General Info ---

PyTouch is a gtk clone of freeware program Pytacz Master i(PM) written in
Python.

PyTouch is created to ask questions on various topics based on a test that
you or somebody else creates. It is designed for you to remember all the
things in your test.

The main goal for me was to make similar program working with linux without
need to use wine. It probably won't have so many features as PM, but i plan
to implement the most important features along with test editor.


						-2- Example of test ---

It's available in tests/test.txt

It uses native files of PM cause I wanted it to be compatible with the Windows
version. I'm experiencing some trouble (I guess with encoding) so it's not
really possible to easily make your own tests now without PM.


						-3-	Launching ---

Launch it by simple running
$ python pytouch.py
