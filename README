						-1- General Info ---

PyTouch is a gtk clone of freeware program Pytacz Master written in Python.

PyTouch is created to ask questions on various topics based on a test that
you or somebody else creates. It is designed for you to remember all the
things in your test.

The main goal for me was to make similar program working with linux without
need to use wine. It probably won't have so many features as PM, but i plan
to implement the most important features along with test editor.


						-2- Example of test ---

Here's how correct common PM test looks like:

--------

[Kolumny]
1=First column name
2=Second column name

[Dane]
run away¤=¤leave quickly to avoid trouble/danger
come on¤=¤hurry up/make an effort
clam up¤=¤refuse to say anything
ring up¤=¤telephone sb
brake up¤=¤end a relationship
catch up¤=¤reach sb ahead of one, by hurrying
crack up¤=¤have a nervous brakedown

--------
                           
It uses native files of PM cause I wanted it to be compatible with the Windows
version.


						-3-	Launching ---

Launch it by simple running
$ python pytouch.py
